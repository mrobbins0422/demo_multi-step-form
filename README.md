Creating a multi-step form

![Screen Capture](/images/ScreenCapStep1.png)

## ðŸŒŽ Introduction

Nearly all complex applications have multistep forms in them somewhere. I wanted to practice creating forms so I chose this challenge.

## :sparkles: Design Considerations

- Step number background color
  - White when active, transparent to background when not active
- Progress bar between step numbers
  - white (incomplete) or green (complete)
- Fixed height and width on form.
- Put labels inside input boxes with suggestions during fill.
- On NEXT, current page wipes to left, next page wipes in from the right.
- On PREVIOUS, current page wipes out to right, previous page wipes in from the left.

## ðŸ“š Tools

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Grid, Flexbox
