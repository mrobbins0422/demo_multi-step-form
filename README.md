Creating a multi-step form

![Screen Capture](/images/ScreenCapStep1.png)

## 🌎 Introduction

Nearly all complex applications have multistep forms in them somewhere. I wanted to practice creating forms so I chose this challenge.

## :sparkles: Design Considerations

- Step number icon background color:
  - Green for active page, white for inactive page
- Step number background color
  - White for active page, transparent to background when inactive
- Progress bar between step numbers
  - white on step one, green as you progress through forms
- Fixed height and width on form.
  - I don't like the jumping around. Gonna style form min-width around 300px.
- Put labels inside input boxes with suggestions during fill.
- All NEXT buttons positioned to the left.
- All PREVIOUS buttons positioned to the right.
- On NEXT, current page wipes to left, next page wipes in from the right.
- On PREVIOUS, current page wipes out to right, previous page wipes in from the left.
- Unique styling for the SUBMIT button.

## 📚 Tools

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Grid, Flexbox

## 👨‍🎓 What I've learned

I love CSS grid! 💖  I thought I loved CSS flexbox but now I can see we are just really good friends.
